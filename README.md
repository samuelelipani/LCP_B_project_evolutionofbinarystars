# LCP_B_project_evolutionofbinarystars
Analysis of the SEVN code output for simulations of evolving binary stars.
We studied the SEVN output data for different combinations of the input parameters metallicity
Z and common envelope a. We initially explored the characteristics of the evolved systems by
investigating the distributions of their masses, semi-major axis and eccentricity with respect to
the different combinations of Z and a. Furthermore, we highlighted the binary systems that
happen to merge in a Hubble time in order to study the production of gravitational waves.
Eventually we performed a statistical analysis with the aim of understanding the role of Z and a
in the merging mechanism of the binary systems.
